**Purpose**: Educational exploration of Spring Boot and MVC architecture.

**Description**:
- User Logic: Implemented user-related functionality, including:
  - Adding track items with properties such as Track Name, Artist, and Track Status.
  - Removing track items.
  - Changing track status.
- Main List Page: Created a page where unauthenticated users can view tracks with public status.
- Registration Logic: Added user registration functionality.

**Technologies Used**:
- **Spring Boot**: Leveraged Spring Boot for building the project.
- **MVC Structure**: Implemented the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
- **Hibernate**: Utilized Hibernate for database interaction, including writing HQL queries.
- **Maven**: Developed the project using Maven, which simplifies project management, handles dependencies, and automates building and packaging.
  
**Learning Goals**:
- MVC Understanding: Gained insights into how MVC components (Model, View, Controller) interact.
- Project configuring: Configured the `pom.xml` file to manage dependencies, specify build phases, and define plugins.
- Hands-On Experience: Practiced real-world development by building a functional application.
